# PsiToolkit

This repository is my personal collection of various useful ObjC methods - extensions (additions) to native Cocoa,
UIKit and Foundation classes, which I used in several projects, and I figured it's better to keep them in one place
as a whole set instead of copying the methods one by one when necessary.

Feel free to use the code if you happen to find it useful, but don't expect much...
